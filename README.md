## User Story 

As a clan/group leader who wants to plan a gaming session:

I have a search bar to find my favorite games

When I find my favorite game,

   * I see relevant information about it.
    I can save a list of favorite games

When I want to make a play session

   * I can easily set a data, time, and description of what we're playing and send that to my friends

Once I've created a session, 

   * I can view my future sessions when visiting the site again.
